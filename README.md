## Creating a Node Server

To spin up a server using Node you need to import some of the Node's core functionality.

Node Core Modules:

- _http_ module is designed with http interface to support many of the protocols features.
- _https_ module is designed for http protocol over TLS/SSL.
- _fs_ module enables us to interact with the file system. In a way it is modeled on standard POSIX functions.
- _path_ module provides utillities for working with file and directory paths.
- os module provides utilities such as methods and properties used for interacting with the operating system.
